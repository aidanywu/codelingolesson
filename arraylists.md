# ArrayLists

## What are ArrayLists?
An ArrayList is a collection that stores objects. To create an ArrayList, declare a variable with a data type of ArrayList, and point it to a new ArrayList object. The initial size of an ArrayList is zero. The size of an ArrayList depends on the methods called.

Creating an Arraylist:
ArrayList<type> nameofarraylist= new ArrayList<type>();

```
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
```

# Useful Arraylist Methods
The following are commonly used methods for ArrayList:

```
arrayList.add(element);
arrayList.add(index, element);
arrayList.set(index, element);
arrayList.remove(index);
arrayList.get(index);
```

## Arraylist Hacks:
Choose one of these options to do. Doing another option will be extra credit
- Test if two arraylists contain the same elements in reverse order
- Overwrite all the elements in an arraylist with the alphabet
- Remove every other element from an arraylist
